# My-First-Selenium-Automation-Project-DemoBlaze-E-Commerce-Testing-

I’m thrilled to share my first automation testing project, where I built a Python-Selenium script to automate an end-to-end user journey on hashtag#DemoBlaze..

#What I automated:
1.User Sign-Up and Login
2.Navigating product categories
3.Selecting a product, adding it to the cart
4.Placing an order (completing the checkout form)

#Testing approaches demonstrated:
#FunctionalTesting: Validated that each feature — from registration to purchase — performs correctly Selenium.
#End-to-End Testing: Verified the entire workflow from start to finish in one seamless script AIE2E Automation.
#SmokeTesting (informal): The flow also serves as a quick sanity check to ensure the app’s core functionality is stable.
#What’s next: I’m looking forward to extending this into a hashtag#fullRegression Test Suite, enabling re-testing after every update to ensure stability and reliability..

#This project helped me sharpen my automation skills and understand how different testing strategies play a role in real-world development. Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!
